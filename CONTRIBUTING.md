Please make a PR if you wish to add an amusing or interesting term!

The requirements are:

- The keys `term`, `kana`, `romaji`, and `translation` must be defined.
- It must be fun! I understand that this is very subjective, but please do your best!

Besides the required keys, any additional relevant fact can be included with an extra key-value
pair. Please style the key `like this`, not with `kebab-case`, `camelCase`, `snake_case`, etc.
